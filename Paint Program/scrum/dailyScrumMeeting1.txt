Oct 31, 2018
	Yesterday :I started thinking about the UserStories.
	Today     :We had our first meeting and created a merge conflict on purpose
	so that we can learn how to solve them.

	how to solve them.

Nov 2, 2018
	Yesterday : I claimed UserStory1.
	Today     : I started working on UserStory1. It is not a tough user story
	as it is similar to the bug we fixed in Lab07  
	Obstacles : 

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday : Started working on UserStory1.
	Today     :I created UserStory1 branch and finished UserStory1. Now a 
	a circle is drawn by clicking at the centre and releasing the mouse at the 
	perimeter. I merged the branch to the master, and pushed the branch as well.
	Obstacles : As I use mac, git asked me to write a message while merging, 
	it was hard to figure out how to write a message as git was chosen a random 
	text editor for the task. But I have managed to figure out a way to write the 
	message and after merging I pushed to the master branch.

	Yesterday : Completed UserStory1 merged the branch.	
	Today     : I claimed UserStory5 and started thinking about how to

	Yesterday : Claimed UserStory5
	Today     : Today I did research on how to change the colors of the buttons
	and think about how to implement color chooser. (On the bottom pane) I could 
	not start coding as I have a test tomorrow.

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday : Research on button background colors.
	Today     : Today I created the UserStory5 branch and started working on

	Yesterday : Created branch UserStory5
	Today     : Today I worked on UserStory5, ColorChooser is a complex feature
	to add.

	the color is changed and a shape is created all shapes are painted in that
	color. 

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday : Implemented ColorChooser
	Today     : I finally figured out how to correctly implement color chooser,
	I also added border lines for color buttons. I am planning to discuss some

	Today     : I have merged UserStory5 to the master. In our meeting we 
	UserStory7 with Ray, creating 5 different thickness selections.

	Yesterday : Merging UserStory5 and implementing UserStory7
	Today     : Today we had another meeting and finished Bug1 and Bug2, we now
	have icons and the selected button is highlighted. I also started thinking

	will be the most useful ones.
